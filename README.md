### Hi, I'm Laetitia 👋

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/laetitiaCA/laetitiaCA/blob/master/laetittia_readme.JPG">

Besides playing with data, I'm a STACK author and reviewer on Moodle (https://ecampus.idems.international/course/view.php?id=53), a mathcamp facilitator and a 21st Century Skills facilitator. I'm the creator of https://www.instagram.com/c__laetitia/, an instagram page that features hiking trails along the Rift Valley, Kenya, as well as a few other countries. My background is Applied Statistics. I currently work at African Maths Intiative.

Things i am learning right now:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a webiste for a virtual Mathcamp, besides other coding work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML,CSS and Javascript.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on developing an interactive website.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with reviewing code documentation.
- 💬 Ask me about best unknown hiking trails along the Rift Valley, Kenya.
- 📫 How to reach me: claetitia.a@gmail.com or Twitter https://twitter.com/c__laetitia
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love cycling and i'm currently building up my mileage to eventually be able to do my first gran fondo! Oh, and my iris change color. 👁👁.
